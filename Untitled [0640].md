  Перевод знаменитого анекдота. Спасибо  [RetXiRT  [email protected]  @$](http://Hellspawn.diary.ru "Atomicautionuclear")  за консультации по переводу (фактически, он подсказал большинство ключевых мест, чтобы они выглядели клёво).   
   
 So, there was a russian writer called Eduard Limonov   
   
  [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard\_Limonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Limonov)    
   
 One of his most famous books is "It's Me, Eddie". The main character is the same as the author, but this is fiction.   
   
 This book contains a scene, where Limonov sucks a Negro's dick.   
   
 \* \* \*   
   
 Eduard Limonov was asked for an interview. He thinks: "They always ask me about that Negro. How should I answer that time?"   
   
 He stands in front of the mirror and tries to recite the upcoming interview:   
   
 "So, Mr. Limonov, is this true that you were fellating a Negro?"   
 "Supposedly so, what about it? This is none of your business."   
   
 No, this is a bad answer.   
   
 "So, Mr. Limonov, is this true that you were fellating a Negro?"   
 "No, this is just an artistic exaggeration."   
   
 No, this is also a bad answer.   
   
 "So, Mr. Limonov, is this true that you were fellating a Negro?"   
 "Your questions are stupid. Ask one more and I'll leave!"   
   
 "Yes, this is an excellent answer", he decided and went for an interview.   
   
 \* \* \*   
   
 The interview begins. The journalist says:   
   
 "So, Mr. Limonov, is this true that you are a racist and nazi?"   
 "Are you crazy? I was even fellating a Negro once!"
