  So, I had to prepare for this damn English exam. I really had. But my active vocabulary was very small and all, so what I did was, I sort of opened my book closet and searched through it. Finally, I found some English literature books, but I didn't feel like reading them. Also I found some vocabularies and this book, by Salinger. I heard something about he, he is famous and all. He wrote those terrific books, they say. But I didn't know its name in English. Only in Russian. Anyway, I took this goddam book from the bookshelf and sort of looked through it. This book was in English, but published in USSR.   
   
 I sort of searched about him through the Internet. What I figured out was, this book was  *that*  famous book, which English title I didn't know. Anyway, I began to read. The book was written in strange language and all. No kidding. In the end of the book I found some comments on the language form the publisher. Some of them was very Soviet and phony, but I didn't care.   
   
 Some days I didn't feel like reading, so I passed the exam and  *still*  didn't finished reading. Finally, yesterday, I did it.   
   
 This book is a long coolstory, in various meanings. Especially, as in is mentioning in imageboards. I don't know what to say about whole book, but some scenes were very interesting and all. Especially in the end. This guy, Holden, decided to hit the road and go far away and he wanted to see his little sister before. His little sister is only ten years old, but she is smarter than Rin form Usagi Drop. Far smarter and wittier. No kidding. He wrote her a letter and finally they met.   
   
 What I read next, it was   
   
  *«What the hell's in that bag? I don't need anything. I'm just going the way I am. I'm not even taking the bags I got at the station. What the hellya got in there?»   
 She put the suitcase down.   
 «My clothes,» she said. «I'm going with you. Can I? Okay?»*    
   
 Boy, was I freaked out. I really was. I wish old Fushimi Tsukasa read this book. When I read this passage, I made such a funny face, that other people turned their heads toward me. No kidding. I was damn near to give one my friend a buzz. He was   sort of interested in that   . But finally I didn't give a damn.   
   
 When I finished, I read the introduction word by the publisher. I read about damn deep meaning of those book, psychology and all, That killed me. I didn't found it by myself. Anyway, I am hardly confident that author meant that.   
   
 Please read this book in English. Russian translations are crap. The peculiarity of language is very important here.
